US Cost of Living Analysis

Significance of the Project:
The cost of living is a significant factor affecting the lives of millions of people in the US. By understanding the underlying dynamics of the cost of living, we can provide valuable insights to policymakers, businesses, and individuals. This analysis aims to unearth patterns and relationships in the cost of living data across different states and counties in the US.

Potential Questions:
How do different factors like housing, food, transportation, and healthcare contribute to the overall cost of living in various areas?
Is there a significant difference in the cost of living between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas?
Can we predict the median family income based on the various cost components?
Which states or counties have the highest and lowest costs of living?
How does the number of family members impact the overall cost of living?
Project Structure:
Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions

Purpose: EDA helps in understanding the data's underlying structure, identifying anomalies, and checking the assumptions of our models.
Question: What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a logistic regression model?
Part 2: Model Building and Evaluation

Purpose: To create logistic regression, linear regression, and multiple linear regression models to predict various outcomes based on the dataset.
Question: What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?
Part 3: Interpreting Model Results

Purpose: To understand the implications of the model's results and how they can inform real-world decisions.
Questions:
What key insights emerged from your model(s)?
What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?
PACE Stages:

Throughout the project, we'll adhere to the PACE problem-solving framework: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.
